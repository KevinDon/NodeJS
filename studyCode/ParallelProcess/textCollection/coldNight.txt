Cold Night - Sarah MacDougall
While the sunlight freezes up
I think of you again
And the snow is lying cold
Looks like the blanket on this town
And it drips down from the roof tops
While I hear the winter whisper
That everything is naked
And stark underneath
You coming to my mind
Like so many times before
Seems like it's been forever
Since I couldn't let you go
And all my mistakes
Dig themselves into my heart again
And all your words they come back
So much clearer to me now
And it's cold cold night
Leaves me breathless and in doubt
There's a silence and a calm tonight
And I wonder if I was right
I remember every word that you said
But I wonder if I was really
The love you drink it all of full
And the trees white and drunk
And strip down of their clothes
And I realize I am not sure
What you look like anymore
But every cell says I remember you well
But it's been so long since I saw you laugh out loud
And if I could I play our boat snow it tonight
Cause something is erupting in the ground underneath
And it's cold cold night
Leaves me breathless and in doubt
There's silence and cold tonight
And I wonder if you were right
And it's cold cold night
Leaves me breathless and in doubt
There's silence and cold tonight
And I wonder if anyone was right
