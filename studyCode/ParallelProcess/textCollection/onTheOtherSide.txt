Phillip LaRue - On the Other Side
Let let the tears
fall down on the ground
Let em turn into a river
and carry you away
Let go of whats inside you
Brother don't be afraid
Feel feel the sun again
Let it all begin let if
fall upon your shadows
like a whisper on your face
Let the silver voices guide
you till you're standing in flames
Oooh oooh ooh oooh oooh ooh
Oooh oooh ooh oooh oooh ooh
Oooh oooh ooh oooh oooh ooh
When when you can't hold on
When you're strength is gone
When all that you can manage
is sending up a cry
I'll be standing right beside you
till you reach the other side
Oooh oooh ooh oooh oooh ooh
Oooh oooh ooh oooh oooh ooh
Oooh oooh ooh oooh oooh ooh
Don't close your eyes
Let the light guide you home
I'm here in the fire
Like a match to the sky
Lightin' up the night for you
Oooh oooh ooh oooh oooh ooh
Oooh oooh ooh oooh oooh ooh
Oooh oooh ooh oooh oooh ooh
I'll see you on the other side
I'll see you on the other side
I'll see you on the other side
I'll see you on the other side
